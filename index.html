		A brief introduction about myself is that I am born and raised in Melbourne, Australia and as of September 2024, 
		I am in my fourth and final year of the Bachelor of Applied Science (Surveying) (Honours) course. My surveying-
		related interests are drafting up different plans of survey, conducting different types of field surveys and 
		solving any cadstral surveying related problems. My current surveying project involves the operation of a 
		semi-autonomous sonar boat to perform a hydrographic survey at a large lake to determine silt levels.

		My own personal hobbies include running and reading!

		Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) consists of recreating real life objects and structures using 3-dimensional point clouds gathered either in the field 
        by myself or from already gathered pictures/point clouds provided. Overall, there were 3 assignments and 3 quizzes over the course of the subject, with
        the quizzes being mainly knowledge checks and the other 3 assignments involved the creation of a point cloud in some manner or form. Assignment 1 involved 
        gathering pictures of a Melbourne Gaol door and recreating the imaging using a point cloud. Assignment 2 involved using ArcGIS Pro to perform basic
        analytic tasks using said datasets and finally the final assignment involved reconstructing a building in ArcGIS Pro and then exporting that data into 
        Cloud Compare to see the reconstruction as a 3D point cloud. Below are the exact assignments performed:
		<ul> <!--Bullet points below-->
			<li>Practical 1: 3D reconstruction of Melbourne Gaol using Terrestrial and Mobile Laser Scanners</li>
			<li>Practical 2: Visualising Aerial LiDAR data and creating surface models</li>
			<li>LiDAR Assignment: Extracting 3D building models from Point Cloud and Point Cloud analysis</li>
            <li>Quizzes 1-3</li>
		</ul> <!--End of bullet points-->

	<div class="paragraphs">
		Cadastral Surveying Law was a subject that consisted of two main factors. The first being how laws surrounding cadastral surveying works and how we as 
        surveyors can work with them.
        Over the timeframe of the course, there were a total of 6 submissions:
		<ul>
			<li>A Practical Survey performed at Parkville</li>
			<li>An Urban Cadastral Reestablishment</li>
			<li>A Plan of Subdivision</li>
            <li>An Abstract of Field Records</li>
            <li>5 quizzes and a test regarding the laws learned during the course </li>
		</ul>
        The Abstract of field records was drafted initially by hand and then drawn up in AutoCAD for a cleaner version similar to those in the industry.

		I am currently working at Breese Pitt Dixon (BPD) as an assistant surveyor. My time there so far as taught me a great 
		amount about the industry itself and the standard that is to be met while a part of the surveyinmg industry. I chose 
		to work at BPD as a family friend referred me to someone in the company when i was seeking a job in the industry. 
		BPD focuses on many different areas in the engineering and surveying industries such as that of cadastral surveying 
		work, locating and marking title boundaries, subdivions etc.
		<p>
		As part of the surveying team, the work that i perform as an assistant mainly consists of cadastral projects, estate work,
		subdivions and some office work. These tasks usually require the operation of a total station, staking out specific points
		and marking them, drafting up plans in the office to help with other jobs etc. At BPD we use Trimble total stations, GPS
		units, controllers and more. Drones are also another piece of equipment that gets operated quite frequently and is mainly 
		used to track stockpiles and take aerial photos. Liscad and MicroStation are the main coomputer programs used in the office.
